We collect usage information, device model, Windows build number and crash information through [AppCenter](https://appcenter.ms), to help fix bugs and continue working on the app.

We cannot identify users' profiles or other information other than the information listed above through AppCenter.

An option to opt out of this tracking will be implemented soon to comply with GDPR, but crashes will be still tracked.
